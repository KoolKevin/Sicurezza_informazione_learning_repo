A distributed ledger is a **replicated, shared, and synchronized database** geographically spread across multiple sites.
- A peer-to-peer network is required as well as consensus algorithms to ensure replication across nodes.
- The blockchain is actually a type of distributed ledger organised as a chain of linked blocks.

Distinguiamo:
- **Permissionless**:
    - open network available for anyone to interact and participate in consensus validation.
    - Fully decentralized across unknow parties.
- **Permissioned**:
    - closed network. Designated parties interact and participate in consensus validation.
    - Partially decentralized.
- **Tokenized ledgers**:
    - transactions involve some kind of purely digital asset (token) represented within the ledger.
- **Tokenless ledgers**:
    - distributed ledgers which do not offer any asset as incentive for being part of it or expect no payment for deploying smart contracts.
    - They are typically permissioned, and thus strong trust has already been established during the registration process.
